"Use Hyperspectral Data to implement a neural network to identify trees"


INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO GET THIS WORKING
clone the git repo
copy the data files into the directory of your git repo
make sure that you ignore the files when making commits as the files are too large


NOTEBOOKS

DataMining.ipynb 
	Ingests the at-sensor-refl data and sorts based on hyperspectral curve
	outputs an H5 file with training data for the neural network
	

NeuralNetwork.ipynb
	Very simple neural network that distiguishes between pixels of tree
	crowns and non tree crowns
 
 
3DNeuralNetwork.ipynb 
    Shells code
    follows guide https://towardsdatascience.com/pytorch-step-by-step-implementation-3d-convolution-neural-network-8bf38c70e8b3
    is meant for RGB images
    comments clarify current issues
    
2DCNN.ipynb
    built using references

    https://github.com/rachellea/pytorch-computer-vision
    focused on Demo program 2
    has dependenies all over the place, src/run_experiment.py, ./utils.py... etc 
        refer to the github link to better understand the file organization. 
    Has issue with creating Tensor structures from hyperspec data, original code was designed for RGB data
    
treeVSnot.h5 
      Data file that has 4 lists 
      traingingdata and labels 
      and testing data and labels.
