"Use Hyperspectral Data to implement a neural network to identify trees"


INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO GET THIS WORKING
clone the git repo
copy the data files into the directory of your git repo
make sure that you ignore the files when making commits as the files are too large


NOTEBOOKS

DataMining.ipynb 
	Ingests the at-sensor-refl data and sorts based on hyperspectral curve
	outputs an H5 file with training data for the neural network
	

NeuralNetwork.ipynb
	Very simple neural network that distiguishes between pixels of tree
	crowns and non tree crowns
